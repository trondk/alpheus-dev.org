//     source goes on from the next chunk, after checking the chunks it
//     makes again (GO-92).
//   - pass when it has committed half its output: it goes on from the
//     first unprocessed chunk and deletes output it never committed
//     (GO-37, GO-70).
//   - sink when it has acked half its input, before EOS: a stateful step
//     reads all its input again (GO-95, GO-100).
//
// Each time the run must succeed with every chunk once and unchanged, and
// no step may count a chunk twice.
