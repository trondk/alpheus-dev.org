"""grep is the template for an Alpheus component in Python.

It keeps the lines of each input chunk that contain a text, and writes them
as one output chunk per input chunk, with the input's file extension. A
chunk without matching lines gives no output. Lines are copied byte for
byte, so with an empty match the output is the input.

Settings: {"match": "ERROR", "invert": false}

It counts the units lines_in and lines_out, and warns about an empty input
chunk with the code empty_chunk.

Copy this folder to start a component: replace handle with your own, keep
alpheus.run at the end.
